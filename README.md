# Event Sequence Prediction Benchmark

The benchmark is focused on the long-horizon prediction of event sequences.

Each event is characterized by its time, label and possible extra structured data.

# Installation
Sometimes the following parameters are necessary for a successful dependency installation:
```
CXX=<c++-compiler> CC=<gcc-compiler> pip install .
```

# Submodules
Make sure to get the necessary GIT submodules:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
